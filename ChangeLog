v0.1 Original version, based on pctel-0.9.7-9-rht-5 PCTel driver with
     hardware/binary-specific changes for ES2898

v0.2 Support >= 2.6.16 kernels
     MODULE_PARM -> module_param
     eliminate double-locking in 2.6.13 and later kernels (caused kernel panic in FC4/5)
     fix minor memory leak

v0.3 Support kernels from 2.6.17 through 2.6.20, at least
     smarter about where to find kernel version info
     compare gcc to kernel version
     big code cleanup (move most tty stuff into linmodem section,
         eliminate duplication)
     fix for "__udiv" problem - use right shift instead
     correct udev control file syntax

v0.4 Updates through 2.6.24
     mostly just fixing deprecated calls
     cleaned up Makefile a bit
     Added a configure feature for module builders where they can override the
     kernel path used instead of defaulting to the one they're running

v0.5 Updates through 2.6.27
     some structures changed names/hierarchy
     also, may be some type of bug in modtools - had to change order of binary module to get clean esscom_hw.ko
     picked up some configure script improvements from Marvin Stodolsky

v0.6 Updates through 2.6.31
     a few more structs changing name in the tty subsystem
     support for DKMS (with help from Marvin Stodolsky)

v0.7 For 3.0.0 kernels.  Just a little bit of cleanup.

Instructions for installing your ES2898 modem driver under Linux 2.6 kernels
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) unpack the driver:

tar xvzf ess_2.6-v0.1.tar.gz

2) run the installation script:

cd ess_2.6-v0.1
su
(type your root password at the prompt)
./setup

This should install the driver modules into the kernel and create the
"device special file" /dev/ttyS_ESS0 and a link from there to /dev/modem.  At
this point you should be able to configure your modem using whatever method
your distro supports and dial out using kppp or wvdial as appropriate.

Some potential problems and their solutions:

1) You reboot, and /dev/ttyS_ESS0 is no longer there

This probably means the kernel modules are not being loaded at boot time.
In most distributions there is a file that controls this - either /etc/modules
or /etc/modprobe.conf.  You can edit these files as root, OR better yet, use
whatever kernel module configuration tool is supplied by your distribution.
For example, in SuSE you would run YaST->System->/etc/sysconfig Editor, from
which you pick System->Kernel->MODULES_LOADED_ON_BOOT.  The modules you
should list are "linmodem", "esscom_hw", and "esscom", in that order.


2) You reboot, and /dev/ttyS_ESS0 is there but /dev/modem is not.

Most distributions now use a method for creating the device special files called
"udev".  The driver setup process tries to be clever about detecting this situation,
but may have failed, or possibly detected udev when it was not present.  The
easiest solution is to edit your modem configuration (e.g., through kppp or
your distro's system configuration tool) to specify that the modem is
/dev/ttyS_ESS0 instead of /dev/modem.

If you have udev and the setup process did not detect it, it should be very simple
to fix.  You need to create (as root) a file called /etc/udev/rules.d/ess.rules,
with the following line inside:

KERNEL=="ttyS_ESS0", SYMLINK="modem"

after another reboot, or even sooner, /dev/modem should reappear.


3) You see the following line in your system log:

Apr 16 21:52:58 linux kernel: PPP: VJ decompression error

I see that too, and I don't have an explanation... yet.  So far it appears to be harmless.


4) I don't live in the USA.  How do I set my country code correctly?

Take a look at the "country_code_list" file.  Hopefully your country is there.  If
not, choose one whose dial tone, etc. is as similar as possible to yours.  You can
either add a special parameter to the esscom module, by adding a line like this to
/etc/modprobe.conf (or whatever your distro's module load file is):

options esscom country_code=1

(that example was for Japan, entry 1 in the country_code_list)

or you can use a special AT command in the initialization string.  For Germany
(entry 2), for example:

AT*NC=2

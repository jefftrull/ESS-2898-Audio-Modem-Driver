This code generates a working 32b kernel driver for ESS 2898 audio modems by taking an old "binary blob" driver for the device, released sometime in the distant past (kernel 2.4.something) and never updated, and programmatically applies various types of hacks.  The result is a tarball that can be distributed to users of the device and run under modern kernels.

In order to build the tarball with this code, you will also need a copy of the old binary blob driver, which I have not included.  At the time of writing one was located here:

The one I use has a SHA1 of 29cf07583c52cac1d0b2834672f6e55e6806bfd7 (as did the above).
